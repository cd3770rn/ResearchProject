      <h1>An Introduction to Hydropower</h1>
      <p>Hydropower is electricity that is generated by the gravitational force of falling or moving water. It is the most common form of renewable energy, providing 16.6% of the world's total electricity, and 70% of all renewable energy ("Definition: Hydroelectric Power"). In addition, it is the most efficient form of producing energy, being capable of converting as much as 90% of the available energy into electricity (Alternative Energy, "Hydroelectric Power").</p>
      
      <h2>How Is Energy Produced from Water?</h2>
      <p>Hydroelectric power is produced by the release of water which drives a turbine connected to an electric generator. There are many sources of water that can be utilized in order to produce energy in this way, but the two most common forms are falling water and currents. Both forms rely on gravity to move the water. When the water begins to move, gravitational potential energy changes into kinetic energy. Upon contact with the generator, some of this energy becomes mechanical energy which spins the turbine blades and in turn makes the generator produce electricity.</p>

      </figure>
      <br>
      
      <p>The amount of energy created by a hydroelectric project is largely dependent on the force exerted by the water acting on the turbine and the amount of moving water. A volume of water that falls 100 feet will produce about twice as much energy as the same amount of water falling from 50 feet. Similarly, if the amount of water is doubled, so too is the amount of energy it produces (Doman, 646).</p>
      
      <br>
      
      <h2>Where Does the Water Come From?</h2>
      <p>There are a number of different ways that water is gathered to produce electricity. Rivers, rainfall, and even the ocean are just a few common sources of water used in hydropower systems.</p>
 
      <h3>The Hydrologic Cycle</h3>
      <p>The water cycle plays a crucial part in the generation of hydroelectricity. Rainwater replenishes water lost to evaporation  needed to maintain water levels in the reservoirs that fuel the hydroelectric plant. The majority of this water comes from oceans, though rivers, lakes and ponds contribute a significant amount as well. The more rainfall, the less energy is expended on maintaining reservoir levels by using pumped storage.</p>
      
      <h3>Dams and Reservoirs</h3>
      <p>In conventional hydroelectric power plants, water is stored within a reservoir created by dam. The water is stored in the reservoir until it is needed. The water intake inside of the dam controls the flow of water through the penstock and to the turbine. Such fine control of the waterflow is necessary to facilitate an appropriate release of energy during peak hours. Some systems are unique in that they feature a reservoir located at the top of the dam and another water source at the bottom. This allows for pumped storage, where water is pumped uphill back into the reservoir. Generally, this occurs at night to ensure that water levels in the reservoir are sufficient for the coming day's energy demands.</p>

      <br>
      
      <h3>Run-of-the-River</h3>
      <p>Run-of-the-river systems, as the name suggests, rely on the flow of the river passing through a low-level dam to generate electricity. They typically do not feature reservoirs, and as a result cannot store large quantities of water. The supply of electricity from this kind of system is very susceptible to changes caused by seasonal fluctuations in river levels. (Doman, 647). Although run-of-the-river systems are capable of large-scale power generation, they are commonly used to provide energy to individual communities, with capacities of less than 30MW ("Hydropower and Other Water Energy Technologies").</p>
      
      <h3>Current Generation</h3>
      <p>River currents can also be utilized to generate energy. It works similarly to a wind turbine, but underwater instead of on land. An underwater turbine is much more capable of producing energy than a wind turbine because water is denser than air, and subsequently water moving at a given speed will produce much more energy than that of comparable wind speed ("Hydropower and Other Water Technologies"). Current generation can be applied in many locations, but environmental impacts of producing energy in this way are not clear, as turbines may harm aquatic populations.</p>
      
      <br>
        
      <h1>The Environmental Impacts of Hydropower</h1>
      <p>While hydropower is generally touted as a clean alternative to fossil-fuel burning power plants like coal and oil, it is not a completely clean way to produce energy. In constructing a reservoir for a dam, a large amount of land must first be flooded. The exact amount of land that will be flooded is highly dependent on the surrounding topography, as a flat area will obviously require more flooding to reach an equivalent water level to that of a hilly area which can hold a larger volume of water in a smaller space.</p>
        
      <h2>Flooding of Land</h2>
      <p>Flooding land for the construction of a hydroelectric reservoir has a major impact on the environment. Forests, wildlife habitats, and any surrounding lands can be destroyed in the process. In some cases, even entire communities may be forced to relocate to make way for reservoirs, as was the case for the Three Gorges Dam in China ("Environmental Impacts of Hydroelectric Power").</p>
        
      <h2>Impacts on Wildlife</h2>
      <p>In addition to land impacts, hydroelectric plants can have a direct impact on wildlife both inside the reservoir and downstream from the power plant. As water inside of a reservoir is typically more stagnant than water in a river, there is an increased chance for larger populations of algae and other aquatic weeds. This can create new pressures for existing animal and plant-life, and so must be controlled by manually cleansing the reservoir of the new vegetation, or by introducing fish that will eat these plants.</p>
      
      <h2>Rapid Evaporation of Reservoirs</h2>
      <p>Another impact of such a large amount of stagnant water is that it evaporates much more quickly than moving water. If the water levels in the reservoir fall too much due to evaporation or the flow of the water exiting the dam is not controlled well enough, the river downstream can dry up. As a result, animals and plants that rely on the river as their water source may suffer.</p>

      </figure>
      
    <h2>Greenhouse Gas Emissions</h2>
      <p>Hydroelectric plants built in locations with a large amount of vegetation such as tropical lands have a much higher environmental impact than those built in less vegetative locations. When a reservoir is created, the area is flooded, which causes plant life and soil to decompose and emit greenhouse gases. The emissions include carbon dioxide from the decay of trees and smaller plants that are partially or completely submerged in the reservoir, as well as methane, a much more impactful greenhouse gas. In many cases, greenhouse gas emissions may even outpace fossil-fuel burning power plants that produce a similar amount of energy (Is Large-Scale Hydropower Sustainable?: Taking a Specific Look into Latin America). Results from a study conducted on a dam in Brazil concluded that the amount of greenhouse gasses emitted was 3.6 times that of an equivalent amount of electricity produced from oil (Do Hydroelectric Dams Mitigate Global Warming? The Case of Brazil’s CuruÁ-una Dam).</p>
        
      <h1>Hydroelectric Power: A Better Supplementary Source of Energy Than Primary?</h1>
      <p>Undoubtedly, the amount of greenhouse gas emissions a hydropower installation produces is dependent on the amount of plants and vegetation that is displaced when flooding the reservoir. Every hydroelectric power plant has some level of impact on the environment even if minor. To that end, it would be best to limit the impact to the environment as much as possible. Hydropower serves an important purpose in the energy industry, in that it is the only way to store renewable energy short of using batteries, which will lose their charge over time anyway. </p>
        
      <p>According to the World Energy Council, "as hydropower has good synergies with all generation technologies, its role is expected to increase in importance in the electricity systems of the future. This is especially true of pumped hydro used as storage, but also increasingly to balance the volatility caused by increased renewable energy in the system" (World Energy Resources, 21).</p>
        
        <p>Renewable energy is a fantastic way to produce energy, but it cannot be relied upon to power things entirely. There will be days where there is no wind. There will be weeks where there is very little sun. This is where pumped storage comes in, and why utilizing hydroelectricity to supplement power demands makes more sense than constructing thousands of small-to-medium-scale hydropower plants all over the country. Pumped storage allows utility providers to meet power demands by releasing water from the reservoir during peak hours. If renewable energy sources were completely ubiquitous, pumped storage would be absolutely necessary to ensure that power consumption needs were met without fear of brown outs.</p>
    
      <h2>Can Hydroelectricity Power the World?</h2>
      <p>In 2017, energy consumption around the world topped 22,000 TWh (Electricity Domestic Consumption). According to the World Energy Council, there is approximately 10,000 TWh/yr of potential undeveloped capacity for hydropower worldwide. Land-based hydro is insufficient for powering the world, and in fact would only just be capable of powering the United States and China (Electricity Domestic Consumption). However, these statistics only consider land-based hydropower, and do not take into consideration all of the potential for wave and tidal energy capture.</p>
    
      <p>Efforts to construct ocean-based hydroelectric projects have not been overly successful. There are a number of technologies that attempt to capture energy from the repetitive and predictable cycle of the ocean waves. This has proven difficult due to circumstances regarding high costs, difficulty in construction, longterm reliability and durability of the materials, and environmental considerations.</p>
    
      <p>Assuming that wave and tidal energy capture were a well-understood field with a number of successful installations scattered around the globe, total potential capacity would be approximately 29,500 TWh per year solely from the ocean (World Energy Resources, 32). While the combined total for hydropower would be somewhere around 40,000 TWh per year, energy production potential is not evenly distributed throughout the world, as is shown in the table from the World Energy Council below.</p>

  <tr>
    <th></th>
    <th>Total Capacity end of 2015 (GW)</th> 
    <th>Added Capacity in 2015 (GW)</th>

        In addition, intercontinental power transmission at the bottom of the ocean would not only be cost prohibitive but also extremely hard to install and perform maintenance on.</p>
