      <h1>An Introduction to Hydropower</h1>
      <p>Hydropower is electricity that is generated by the gravitational force of falling or moving water. It is the most common form of renewable energy, providing 16.6% of the world's total electricity, and 70% of all renewable energy. In addition, it is the most efficient form of producing energy, being capable of converting as much as 90% of the available energy into electricity.</p>
      
      <h2>How is Energy Produced from Water?</h2>
      <p>Hydroelectric power is produced by the release of water which drives a turbine connected to an electric generator. There are many sources of water that can be utilized in order to produce energy in this way, but the two most common forms are falling water and currents. Both forms rely on gravity to move the water. When the water begins to move, gravitational potential energy changes into kinetic energy. Upon contact with the generator, some of this energy becomes mechanical energy which spins the turbine blades and in turn makes the generator produce electricity.</p>
