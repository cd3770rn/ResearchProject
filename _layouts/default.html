      <h1>An Introduction to Hydropower</h1>
      <p>Hydropower is electricity that is generated by the gravitational force of falling or moving water. It is the most common form of renewable energy, providing 16.6% of the world's total electricity, and 70% of all renewable energy (Definition: Hydroelectric Power). In addition, it is the most efficient form of producing energy, being capable of converting as much as 90% of the available energy into electricity (Alternative Energy, Hydroelectric Power).</p>
      
      <h2>How is Energy Produced from Water?</h2>
      <p>Hydroelectric power is produced by the release of water which drives a turbine connected to an electric generator. There are many sources of water that can be utilized in order to produce energy in this way, but the two most common forms are falling water and currents. Both forms rely on gravity to move the water. When the water begins to move, gravitational potential energy changes into kinetic energy. Upon contact with the generator, some of this energy becomes mechanical energy which spins the turbine blades and in turn makes the generator produce electricity.</p>

      <p>"The amount of energy created by a hydroelectric project depends largely upon two factors: the pressure of the water acting on the turbine and the volume of water available." A volume of water that falls 100 feet will produce about twice as much energy as the same amount of water falling from 50 feet. Similarly, if the amount of water is doubled, so too is the amount of energy it produces  (Macmillan Encyclopedia of Energy, 646).</p>
      
      <br>
      
      <h2>Where Does the Water Come From?</h2>
      <p>The water cycle plays a crucial part in the generation of hydroelectricity. Rainwater replenishes water lost to evaporation  needed to maintain water levels in the reservoirs that fuel the hydroelectric plant. The majority of this water comes from oceans, though rivers, lakes and ponds contribute a significant amount as well.</p>
      
      <p>In conventional hydroelectric power plants, water is stored within a reservoir created by dam. The water is stored in the reservoir until it is needed. The water intake inside of the dam controls the flow of water through the penstock and to the turbine. Such fine control of the waterflow is necessary to facilitate an appropriate release of energy during peak hours. Some systems are unique in that they feature a reservoir located at the top of the dam and another water source at the bottom. This allows for pumped storage, where water is pumped uphill back into the reservoir. Generally, this occurs at night to ensure that water levels in the reservoir are sufficient for the coming day's energy demands.</p>

      <p>Run-of-the-river systems, as the name suggests, rely on the flow of the river passing through a low-level dam to generate electricity. They typically do not feature reservoirs, and as a result cannot store large quantities of water. The supply of electricity from this kind of system is very susceptible to changes caused by seasonal fluctuations in river levels. (Macmillan Encyclopedia of Energy, 647). Although run-of-the-river systems are capable of large-scale power generation, they are commonly used to provide energy to individual communities, with capacities of less than 30MW (Hydropower and Other Water Energy Technologies).</p>
      
      <p>River currents can also be utilized to generate energy. It works similarly to a wind turbine, but underwater instead of on land. An underwater turbine is much more capable of producing energy than a wind turbine because water is denser than air, and subsequently water moving at a given speed will produce much more energy than that of comparable wind speed (Hydropower and Other Water Technologies). Current generation can be applied in many locations, but environmental impacts of producing energy in this way are not clear, as turbines may harm aquatic populations.</p>
