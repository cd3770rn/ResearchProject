      <h1>An Introduction to Hydropower</h1>
      <p>Hydropower is electricity that is generated by the gravitational force of falling or moving water. It is the most common form of renewable energy, providing "16.6% of the worlds total electricity and 70% of all renewable electricity" (Open Energy Information). Moreover, it is the most efficient form of producing energy. In fact, "[m]odern hydro turbines can convert as much as 90% of the available energy into electricity. The best fossil fuel plants are only about 50% efficient. In the US, hydropower is produced for an average of 0.7 cents per kilowatt-hour (kWh). This is about one-third the cost of using fossil fuel or nuclear and one-sixth the cost of using natural gas" (Alternative Energy). Year over year, installed capacity of hydroelectric power plants has nearly increased 4% on average (World Energy Resources).</p>
      
      <h2>How Is Energy Produced from Water?</h2>
      <p>Hydroelectric power is produced by the release of water which drives a turbine connected to an electric generator. There are many sources of water that can be utilized in order to produce energy in this way, but the two most common forms are falling water and currents. Both forms rely on gravity to move the water. When the water begins to move, gravitational potential energy changes into kinetic energy. Upon contact with the generator, some of this energy becomes mechanical energy which spins the turbine blades and in turn makes the generator produce electricity.</p>

      </figure>
      <br>
      
      <p>The amount of energy created by a hydroelectric project is largely dependent on the force exerted by the water acting on the turbine and the amount of moving water. According to the Macmillan Encyclopedia of Energy, "[w]ater that falls 1,000 feet generates about twice as much electric power as the same volume of water falling only 500 feet. In addition, if the amount of water available doubles, so does the amount of energy." (646).</p>
      
      <br>
      
      <h2>Where Does the Water Come From?</h2>
      <p>There are a number of different ways that water is gathered to produce electricity. Rivers, rainfall, and even the ocean are just a few common sources of water used in hydropower systems.</p>
 
      <h3>The Hydrologic Cycle</h3>
      <p>The water cycle plays a crucial part in the generation of hydroelectricity. Rainwater replenishes water lost to evaporation  needed to maintain water levels in the reservoirs that fuel the hydroelectric plant. The majority of this water comes from oceans, though rivers, lakes and ponds contribute a significant amount as well. The more rainfall, the less energy is expended on maintaining reservoir levels by using pumped storage.</p>
      
      <h3>Dams and Reservoirs</h3>
      <p>In conventional hydroelectric power plants, water is stored within a reservoir created by dam. The water is stored in the reservoir until it is needed. The water intake inside of the dam controls the flow of water through the penstock and to the turbine. Such fine control of the waterflow is necessary to facilitate an appropriate release of energy during peak hours. Some systems are unique in that they feature a reservoir located at the top of the dam and another water source at the bottom. This allows for pumped storage, where water is pumped uphill back into the reservoir. Generally, this occurs at night to ensure that water levels in the reservoir are sufficient for the coming day's energy demands.</p>
      
      <br>

      </figure>
      
      <br>
      
      <h3>Run-of-the-River</h3>
      <p>Run-of-the-river systems, as the name suggests, rely on the flow of the river passing through a low-level dam to generate electricity. They typically do not feature reservoirs, and as a result cannot store large quantities of water. The supply of electricity from this kind of system is very susceptible to changes caused by seasonal fluctuations in river levels. (Doman, 647). Although run-of-the-river systems are capable of large-scale power generation, they are commonly used to provide energy to individual communities, with capacities of less than 30MW ("Hydropower and Other Water Energy Technologies").</p>
      
      <h3>Current Generation</h3>
      <p>River currents can also be utilized to generate energy. It works similarly to a wind turbine, but underwater instead of on land. An underwater turbine is much more capable of producing energy than a wind turbine because water is denser than air, and subsequently water moving at a given speed will produce much more energy than that of comparable wind speed ("Hydropower and Other Water Technologies"). Current generation can be applied in many locations, but environmental impacts of producing energy in this way are not clear, as turbines may harm aquatic populations.</p>
      
      <br>
        
      <h1>The Environmental Impacts of Hydropower</h1>
      <p>While hydropower is generally touted as a clean alternative to fossil-fuel burning power plants like coal and oil, it is not a completely clean way to produce energy. In constructing a reservoir for a dam, a large amount of land must first be flooded. The exact amount of land that will be flooded is highly dependent on the surrounding topography, as a flat area will obviously require more flooding to reach an equivalent water level to that of a hilly area which can hold a larger volume of water in a smaller space.</p>
        
      <h2>Flooding of Land</h2>
      <p>Flooding land for the construction of a hydroelectric reservoir has a major impact on the environment. Forests, wildlife habitats, and any surrounding lands can be destroyed in the process. Additionally, "[i]n many instances, such as the Three Gorges Dam in China, entire communities have also had to be relocated to make way for reservoirs" ("Environmental Impacts of Hydroelectric Power").</p>
        
      <h2>Impacts on Wildlife</h2>
      <p>Among impacts on the landscape, hydroelectric plants can have a direct impact on wildlife both inside the reservoir and downstream from the power plant. As water inside of a reservoir is typically more stagnant than water in a river, there is an increased chance for larger populations of algae and other aquatic weeds. This can create new pressures for existing animal and plant-life, and so must be controlled by manually cleansing the reservoir of the new vegetation, or by introducing fish that will eat these plants.</p>
      
      <h2>Rapid Evaporation of Reservoirs</h2>
      <p>Another impact of such a large amount of stagnant water is that it evaporates much more quickly than moving water. If the water levels in the reservoir fall too much due to evaporation or the flow of the water exiting the dam is not controlled well enough, the river downstream can dry up. As a result, animals and plants that rely on the river as their water source may suffer.</p>

        <figcaption><strong>Figure 3.</strong> Summary of the impacts of dams and reservoirs ("Impacts of Dams").</figcaption>
      </figure>
      
    <h2>Greenhouse Gas Emissions</h2>
      <p>Hydroelectric plants built in locations with a large amount of vegetation such as tropical lands have a much higher environmental impact than those built in less vegetative locations. When a reservoir is created, the area is flooded, which causes plant life and soil to decompose and emit greenhouse gases. The emissions include carbon dioxide from the decay of trees and smaller plants that are partially or completely submerged in the reservoir, as well as methane, a much more impactful greenhouse gas. In many cases, greenhouse gas emissions may even outpace fossil-fuel burning power plants that produce a similar amount of energy (Is Large-Scale Hydropower Sustainable?: Taking a Specific Look into Latin America). Results from a study conducted on a dam in Brazil concluded that the amount of greenhouse gasses emitted was "3.6 times more . . . than would have been emitted by generating the same amount of electricity from oil" ("Do Hydroelectric Dams Mitigate Global Warming? The Case of Brazil’s CuruÁ-una Dam").</p>
        
      <br>
    
      <h1>Hydroelectric Power: A Better Supplementary Source of Energy Than Primary?</h1>
      <p>Undoubtedly, the amount of greenhouse gas emissions a hydropower installation produces is dependent on the amount of plants and vegetation that is displaced when flooding the reservoir. Every hydroelectric power plant has some level of impact on the environment even if minor. To that end, it would be best to limit the impact to the environment as much as possible. Hydropower serves an important purpose in the energy industry, in that it is the only way to store renewable energy short of using batteries, which will lose their charge over time anyway. </p>
        
      <p>According to the World Energy Council, "as hydropower has good synergies with all generation technologies, its role is expected to increase in importance in the electricity systems of the future. This is especially true of pumped hydro used as storage, but also increasingly to balance the volatility caused by increased renewable energy in the system" (World Energy Resources, 21).</p>
        
        <p>Renewable energy is a fantastic way to produce energy, but it cannot be relied upon to power things entirely. There will be days where there is no wind. There will be weeks where there is very little sun. This is where pumped storage comes in, and why utilizing hydroelectricity to supplement power demands makes more sense than constructing thousands of small-to-medium-scale hydropower plants all over the country. Pumped storage allows utility providers to meet power demands by releasing water from the reservoir during peak hours. If renewable energy sources were completely ubiquitous, pumped storage would be absolutely necessary to ensure that power consumption needs were met without fear of brown outs.</p>
    
      <h2>Can Hydroelectricity Power the World?</h2>
      <p>In 2017, energy consumption around the world topped 22,000 TWh (Electricity Domestic Consumption). According to the World Energy Council, there is approximately 10,000 TWh/yr of potential undeveloped capacity for hydropower worldwide. Land-based hydro is insufficient for powering the world, and in fact would only just be capable of powering the United States and China (Electricity Domestic Consumption). However, these statistics only consider land-based hydropower, and do not take into consideration all of the potential for wave and tidal energy capture.</p>
    
      <p>Efforts to construct ocean-based hydroelectric projects have not been overly successful. There are a number of technologies that attempt to capture energy from the repetitive and predictable cycle of the ocean waves. This has proven difficult due to circumstances regarding high costs, difficulty in construction, long-term reliability and durability of the materials, and environmental considerations.</p>
    
      <p>Assuming that wave and tidal energy capture were a well-understood field with a number of successful installations scattered around the globe, total potential capacity would be approximately 29,500 TWh per year solely from the ocean (World Energy Resources, 32). While the combined total for hydropower would be somewhere around 40,000 TWh per year, energy production potential is not evenly distributed throughout the world, as is shown in the table below.</p>

        <p>In addition to facilitating worldwide energy trade, intercontinental power transmission at the bottom of the ocean would be required. This would not only prove to be cost prohibitive but also extremely hard to install and perform maintenance on, not to mention any potential loss in efficiency as the power travels thousands of miles across the ocean.</p>
    
    <br>
    
    <h1>The Barriers to Fueling the World With Water</h1>
    <p>In an ideal world, it would be feasible to construct hundreds of thousands of hydroelectric power plants across the globe in an effort to power everything entirely from hydroelectricity. In reality, however, there are constraints that will limit and shape the growth of hydropower.</p>
    
    <h2>Pushback from Citizens</h2>
    <p>Undoubtedly, if ten thousand hydroelectric projects began construction tomorrow, many municipalities and communities across the country would be up in arms about particular developments for any number of reasons. Perhaps the power plant would be encroaching on privately owned lands, or maybe the construction may destroy a treasured landscape. Tensions would certainly escalate and hundreds of court cases surrounding the controversy would pop up in county after county. Judicial and municipal roadblocks would inevitably delay and stymie progress on countless numbers of projects.</p>

      <figcaption><strong>Figure 5.</strong> Rendition of underwater hydroelectric turbines built in the ocean (The Ocean & Hydropower Summit).</figcaption>
    </figure>  
    
    <h2>Underdeveloped Ocean Technologies</h2>
    <p>In order to power the world solely from hydropower, there would need to be a great deal of innovation and research in the field of wave and tidal energy capture to make it a viable and more easily implemented way of producing power. In order to produce enough energy to be able to power entire countries, every usable inch of space would need to be utilized. Beautiful ocean vistas across the country would be destroyed by brash industrial power plants scattered up and down the coastline. Activities such as surfing and diving would have reduced access to the waters due to restricted areas surrounding oceanic hydropower plants. The list of things that would be dramatically affected goes on and on.</p>
        
    <h2>How Long Will It Take?</h2>
    <p>Constructing enough hydroelectric power plants to sustain a single country would take an enormous amount of time and labor. On a global scale, there would most certainly be shortages of workers necessary for building hundreds if not thousands of hydropower plants at a time. It would not be a hyperbole to say such an undertaking could take decades to complete, at which point there's no guarantee that global energy consumption would not have outpaced the maximum output of all hydropower.</p>
    
    <h2>Unknown and Unforseen Impacts to the Environment</h2>
    <p>The most important factor to consider is the impact on the environment. Hydropower is hardly ever kind to the environment, regardless of how it is implemented. Constructing thousands of hydroelectric plants in the United States may not pose much of an emissions problem when compared to tropical environments such as South America or parts of Eastern Asia, where large-scale development of hydropower would very likely have a dramatic output of greenhouse gasses, but the adverse affects of so many power plants could very easily be seen here as well. With individual installations potentially producing over 3.5 times more emissions than oil-fueled power plants, multiplying that by hundreds or thousands would very quickly compound an already existing problem. Ultimately, without first constructing and measuring the global output of emissions from hydropower, it would be nearly impossible to determine whether or not the change in emissions would be beneficial to the planet.</p>
    
    <p>Certain types of hydropower plants that rely on subsurface water movement such as those found in current generation can potentially endanger aquatic populations. In areas of the world that are struggling financially, shortcuts may be taken or precautions may be ignored that result in damage to wildlife populations. For example, perhaps safeguards to prevent fish from openly swimming into spinning turbines may be skipped in favor of lower costs. This would obviously have an adverse impact on the fish populations which could potentially affect local communities that rely on the river as their food source.</p>
    
    <br>
    
    <h1>Conclusion: Pumped Storage Is the Future of Hydropower</h1>
    <p>Installed capacity of hydropower grows nearly 4% each year, which is nowhere near enough to complete hydroelectric power plants for the entire world within a reasonable amount of time. Furthermore, such an endeavor would require technology that currently is still in its infancy, would be cost prohibitive, and majorly impactful on the environment on a global scale. In essense, it is not and likely never will be possible to power the entire world solely from hydropower.</p>
    
    <p>All things considered, utilizing pumped storage as a way of storing potential energy for when it is needed is the best use for hydropower. Batteries are large and expensive, and over time will wear out and lose the ability to hold a charge. Storing water in a reservoir costs very little, and can be reused indefinitely. It is the most effective known way of storing energy. Other forms of renewable energy such as wind and solar can be scattered across the country, and pumped storage can be used to handle moments where other energy sources cannot be relied on. Though it doesn't make sense to power entire countries using hydroelectricity, there is still a great amount of undeveloped potential regarding hydropower, and the number of installations of water-based power plants will undoubtedly continue to grow and provide clean renewable energy to communities across the globe.</p>
